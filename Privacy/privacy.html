    <section aria-labelledby="intro">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome. Online Tutoring ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This page explains what information we may collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. We aim to be transparent and keep data handling minimal.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="data-collected">
      <h2 id="data-collected">Information we collect</h2>
        <p>To provide our course booking and education services we collect the following types of information when you or your parent/guardian register or interact with the app:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Identity & contact:</strong> student's full name, parent/guardian name, email address, mobile phone number.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification data:</strong> email address and one-time passcode (OTP) sent to email or phone for account verification; timestamps of verification events.</li>
          <li><strong>Enrollment & course data:</strong> courses booked, attendance records, payment confirmations, receipts and related transaction metadata.</li>
          <li><strong>Optional profile data:</strong> date of birth, grade level, profile preferences, and any information you provide when contacting support or filling forms.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> device type, operating system version, app version, and crash reports (sent only if you opt in to diagnostic reporting).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="usage-data">
      <h2 id="usage-data">How we use your information</h2>
      <p>We use collected information for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To create and verify user accounts (email + OTP verification) and to prevent fraud.</li>
        <li>To process course bookings, manage enrollments, and handle payments and refunds.</li>
        <li>To communicate important information such as booking confirmations, schedule changes, receipts, and support replies.</li>
        <li>To provide, improve, and troubleshoot the app (including optional diagnostic reports if you enable them).</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations and to enforce our terms and policies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="third-parties">
      <h2 id="third-parties">Third-party service providers</h2>
      <p>We work with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf and may process personal data to support the app. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment processors for handling transactions and refunds.</li>
        <li>Email and SMS providers for sending verification codes (OTP), notifications and receipts.</li>
        <li>Cloud hosting providers and analytics or crash reporting tools (only if you opt in to diagnostics).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We require these providers to process data only on our instructions and to maintain appropriate security measures. We do not sell personal information to third parties.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="security">
      <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data. Examples include encrypted storage, access controls, and transport-layer security (HTTPS). However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure; if a data breach affecting personal data occurs, we will notify affected users and regulators as required by law.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="children">
      <h2 id="children">Children’s privacy & parental consent</h2>
      <p>Because our app provides educational services for students, we may collect information about children. We do not knowingly collect information from children without parental consent where required by law.</p>
      <p>If a student is under the age required by local law to provide consent (for example, under 13 in many jurisdictions), we require a parent or guardian to create the account or to provide verifiable parental consent before we collect personal information. Parents may review, correct, or request deletion of their child's personal information by contacting us (see Contact section).</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="rights">
      <h2 id="rights">Your rights</h2>
      <p>Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the personal information we hold about you or your child.</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal information.</li>
        <li>Request deletion of personal information (subject to legal retention requirements).</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain processing, or request portability of data where applicable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at the email below. We will verify requests to protect data security and respond within applicable timeframes.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="cookies">
      <h2 id="cookies">Cookies & tracking</h2>
      <p>We do not use tracking cookies within the app by default. If the website or app implements cookies, we will disclose their use and obtain consent where required. Diagnostic or analytics tools (if enabled) may use non-identifying cookies; you can opt out where such choices are provided.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="changes">
      <h2 id="changes">Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we do, we will update the "Effective date" at the top of this page. Significant changes will be communicated where feasible.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="contact">
      <h2 id="contact">Contact & responsible party</h2>
      <p>If you have questions, wish to exercise rights, or want parental access to a child's account, contact us at:</p>
      <p><a href="mailto:onlinetutoring@gmail.com">onlinetutoring@gmail.com</a></p>
      <div class="note" aria-live="polite">This policy is a general-purpose summary. If you'd like a version tailored for a specific jurisdiction (for example, GDPR or CCPA), a printable PDF, or help with a data request, contact us and we'll assist.</div>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="deletion">
      <h2 id="deletion">Data retention & account deletion</h2>
      <p>We retain account and enrollment data while an account is active to provide services. After an account becomes inactive, we retain personal data for up to <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of last activity to allow for reactivation, billing disputes, and legal obligations, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>
      <p>If you would like your account and associated personal data deleted sooner, you may request deletion. Deletion requests are processed promptly and typically completed within 7 working days. To request deletion, follow our deletion page:</p>
      <p><a href="delete.html">Request account deletion and data removal</a></p>
